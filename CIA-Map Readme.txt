Project:
I previously had little to no experience with: 
-Angular
-Spring Boot
-Leaflet
-CSS
-Writing MVC projects
-Bower
-More than beginner JavaScript.

I recieved a lot of help from my coworker at Manta, Amber Schwartz, who helped me understand the project structure, found a good angular-leaflet github repo to use, and more.
A good amount of the code in this project is written by her as we were working on it. In starting a project, I work best in an environment where I can ask all my dumb questions to learn a new technology.
Working by myself, I know I couldn't get this done in a week. So, during this project, I can say that I:
-Got a practical view of real Spring/MVC Java code structure
-Had my first exposure to AngularJS, Spring Boot, and Bower
-Wrote the java code after directions from Amber
-Wrote the mapSearch function in controllers.js
-Edited the page layout in index.html and leaflet.css
-Ran and Debugged app
-Read through and followed Amber's JavaScript
And observed the rest of the work.
